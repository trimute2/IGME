## Gameplay
### Mechanics
* Combos with up to three attacks

   There are two attacks punch and kick, each point in the combo is different
   1. The opening: certain enemies need to be hit with a specific opening to start a combo
   2. The charge: determines the strength of the third attack in the sequence
   3. The knock back: determines the arc of the enemy takes when the are knocked back
   
* Score system

   Gain points every time you hit an enemy, even when an enemy runs out of health they wont die until they hit the ground after the third move in a combo, allowing for skilled players to keep hitting enemies for more points.
* Aerial attacks and attacks that lift enemies into the air
* An arena system:

   When the player aproaches an enemy or group of enemies, walls show up surronding the player and enemies. Enemies can be bounced off the walls and the walls will disapear when the enemies are defeated. If the player hits the wall they will turn around, the third time the player hits the right wall they will run through it and receive a score penalty for any enemy they havent defeated.
### Controls
Key board and mouse
### Teaching the player
The player is taught the basic mechanics through a tutorial level. This tutorial level gives the player the information on how to beat other levels and hints on how to get better scores. 

ex: The tutorial level explains to the player how to combo an enemy, dummy enemy is posisitioned so that it will knock the enemy into a wall. The game does not bring attention to the fact that they just got extra points, but it does demenstrate the concept.
### Mechanical depth
Im using [this video][1] and [this video][2] to define depth.

On the level of novice players the challenge comes from starting the combo with the right attack, from there the player has four possible combos. For more advanced play the player has the ability to determine the distance there combo knocks back the enemy, allowing them to possibly start a second combo using aerial attacks. For even more advanced play the player can utilise the walls of the arena as well as other enemies to keep enemies in the air and and continue getting a higher score.
