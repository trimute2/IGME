				<h1>Design Goals</h1>
				<p>On, this page I explain the reasoning behind some of the design choices I made.</p>
				<section>
					<h2>Inspiration</h2>
					<p>I am a fan of what I refer to as character action games, this genre is also sometimes referred to as hack and slash or spectacle fighters, the genre evolved from beat'em ups. One of the main ideas behind this project is to make a very simplified character action game/beat'em up, focusing on one of the main concepts of the genre. The core concept that the mechanics focus on is the idea of juggling enemies. Other parts of the game, such as the art style I want and the score system, take inspiration from Viewtiful Joe and the library of Platinum games.</p>

					<h2>Mechanical Depth</h2>
					<p>Before explaining how the mechanics listed give the game depth, I would like to give the definition I use to define what depth means in relation to video games, since the definition I use may be different from yours. Depth is defined as the number of possibilities resulting from the combination of the games basic mechanics and allowing for a divide between skilled and unskilled play. Most of this definition comes from

					by Mark Brown.</p>
					<p>Most of Battle Run's depth comes from the combo system and the arena system, with the score system working to encourage the player to explore the interplay between the mechanics. On the surface level players can simply beat a level by only focusing on the first attack in the combo, allowing for casual play. For more skilled play players can use the second an third moves in their combo to control the arc of the enemy takes after being hit, allowing for the player to land extra combos. This can be done by either bouncing the enemy off of the arena wall back at themselves or by keeping the enemy air born long enough to wall jump off of the arena wall and get a mid air combo. For even more advanced play players can knock enemies into one another for extra points and to keep one of the enemies air born.</p>

					<h2>Teaching The Player</h2>
					<p>The player is taught the basic mechanics of the game through a tutorial level that has text popups. This tutorial will explain the basic mechanics while hinting at some of the more complex mechanics. For example the tutorial will to the player how to combo an enemy, the dummy enemy is positioned so that after its hit by the player it will be knocked back into a wall and increase the players score. A text popup will pause the game to show that the players score went up when they hit the enemy, but there wont be a popup after the enemy hits the wall. This will display the mechanic to the player without stating it outright.</p>
